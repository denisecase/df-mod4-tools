Example repo

## Required

1. Install Git
2. Install VS Code
3. Install Autospsy

## Create GitHub Repo

Create project repository with a default README.md.

## Clone Repo with README.md 

Clone down to local machine

## Open Folder in VS Code

Open Folder in VS Code.

Turn on autosave. From the VS Code Menu, click File / Autosave (or make sure it is checked.)

## Create Folders

Use menu to create 4 folders. 
Click on README.md - to the right of repo name, you'll see a folder icon. Mouse over and it will say "New folder". 
Be sure to click on README.md each time so each folder is created in the root project folder. 

## Exercise 4

Use VS Code to create 3 empty files for saving our messages.

Use [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) to encode our message, then decode it as recovered.

I used the Vigenere cipher, a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. 
It uses a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of different Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword.

My keyword was: zebra

Use VS Code to create [evidence.txt](ex4/evidence.txt) and store the original message.

Use VS Code to create [nothing.txt](ex4/nothing.txt) and store the encrypted message (evidence).

Use VS Code to create [recovered.txt](ex4/recovered.txt) and store the recovered message as useful evidence.
